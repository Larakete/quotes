    <h1>Quotes</h1>
    <p>In this project we want to build a game which gives randomly quotes from the data.js file. This is a perfect way to practise your javascript knowledge.
        Another oportunity to contribute would be to add some quotes to the data.js file.
    </p>

    <p>Steps to accomplish the goal of this project:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript function to call one of the quotes from the js/data.js file</li>
        <li>Button which calls the next quote from the js/data.js file</li>
    </ul>
</body>
