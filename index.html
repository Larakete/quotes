        Our intention is to keep this project as simple as possible and to let everyone contribute who wants to.
        As we want to have a valueable output to give something to the beautiful open source community, we tried to 
        devide this projects into some useful subprojects.

    <p>The following subprojects are implemented (at the moment). At the beginning of the description we added what you will learn by accomplishing the task.</p>

        <li><a href="./quotes.html">HTML/JAVASCRIPT: We want to build a random quote generator</a></li>
